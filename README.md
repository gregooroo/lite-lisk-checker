# lite-lisk-checker
Lite Lisk checker is small bot utilizing [lisk-elements](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-elements) and [Telegram bot - telebot](https://github.com/mullwar/telebot) to check syncing and optionally forging status of your Lisk nodes.

It will automatically notify you if your Lisk node or server went down. However, it is not possible to restart, rebuild node or start forging with this bot.  
## Install
Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or other node.js manager

```
nvm use 8.2.1

git clone https://github.com/biolypl/lite-lisk-checker
 
cdâ€‹ lite-lisk-checker && npm install
```

## Config
Create telegram bot and add key to config.json `telegram`.

Set checking interval in seconds - `interval`.

Add nodes to `nodes` array in config.json every node should be configured:
```
{
      "id": "Forging-server-1",
      "ip": "https://YOUR_IP", (or domain)
      "port": 8443,
      "network": "LSK_M", (LSM_M for mainnet, LSK_T for testnet)
      "checkForging": true (true if you want to launch forging checking)
}
```

#### Example
```
{
      "id": "Testnet-snapshot-server",
      "ip": "http://151.80.47.178", 
      "port": 7000,
      "network": "LSK_T", 
      "checkForging": false
}
```

## Set propose
The idea behind this script was installing them on separate VPS instead machine with Lisk node. You can whitelist only this VPS IP in Lisk config.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>

To get forging status you have to whitelist IP from which checker is run.
